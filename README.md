# FleetGitOpsUploader AutoPkg Processor

Upload a freshly built installer to Fleet using the Software API, then create or update the corresponding YAML in your Fleet GitOps repo and open a pull request. This processor is designed for CI use in GitHub Actions and can also be run locally.

> **⚠️ Experimental:** This processor uses Fleet's [experimental software management API](https://fleetdm.com/docs/rest-api/rest-api#list-software), which is subject to breaking changes. Fleet may introduce API changes that require corresponding updates to this processor. **Production use is not recommended** due to the experimental nature of the underlying Fleet API.

## Current Limitations

- Fleet's API does not yet support searching for existing packages by hash. The processor therefore cannot determine if a package has already been uploaded without attempting an upload. When Fleet returns a `409` conflict (package already exists), the processor exits gracefully without performing GitOps operations. A feature request to add hash-based lookups is being tracked in [fleetdm/fleet#32965](https://github.com/fleetdm/fleet/issues/32965).

---

## Features

- Uploads a `.pkg` to Fleet for a specific team
- Creates a feature branch named `<software-title>-<version>`
- Writes or updates a per-title software YAML file in `lib/macos/software`
- Ensures the team YAML references that software file in `software.packages`
- Commits, pushes, and opens a GitHub pull request
- Idempotent where practical and fails loudly on API errors

---

## Requirements

- **macOS**: Required for AutoPkg execution
- **Python 3.9+**: For the FleetGitOpsUploader processor
- **AutoPkg 2.7+**: For recipe processing
- **Git**: For GitOps repository operations
- **Fleet API Access**: Fleet server v4.70.0+ with software management permissions
- **GitHub Access**: Personal access token with `repo` and `pull-requests` permissions

---

## Why YAML?

AutoPkg [supports both XML (plist) and YAML recipe formats](https://github.com/autopkg/autopkg/wiki/Recipe-Format#overview). I personally find YAML more readable and maintainable than XML, especially for recipes that may be edited by hand or reviewed in code. YAML's indentation and lack of angle brackets make it easier to scan and less error-prone for most users.

Additionally, Fleet's GitOps workflow is driven by YAML files for software configuration and team assignments. By using YAML for both AutoPkg recipes and Fleet GitOps files, this repository maintains consistency and makes it easier to reason about the entire workflow. Aligning with Fleet's format also reduces friction when integrating new tools or automations.

## Recipe Configuration

### Environment Variable Configuration

All recipe arguments use environment variables for maximum flexibility. The processor provides sensible defaults for optional arguments, so you only need to set the variables relevant to your environment.

**Required Environment Variables:**
```bash
export FLEET_API_BASE="https://fleet.myorg.com"
export FLEET_API_TOKEN="your-fleet-token"
export FLEET_TEAM_ID="1"
export FLEET_GITOPS_REPO_URL="https://github.com/myorg/fleet-gitops"
export FLEET_GITOPS_GITHUB_TOKEN="your-github-token"
export FLEET_GITOPS_AUTHOR_EMAIL="autopkg-bot@myorg.com"
export FLEET_TEAM_YAML_PATH="teams/workstations.yml"
```

**Optional Environment Variables (with defaults):**
```bash
# Software configuration (defaults: platform=darwin, automatic_install=false, self_service=true)
export FLEET_PLATFORM="darwin"
export FLEET_SOFTWARE_SLUG="custom-slug"  # defaults to software title if not set
export FLEET_AUTOMATIC_INSTALL="false"
export FLEET_SELF_SERVICE="true"

# Git configuration (defaults: base_branch=main, author_name=autopkg-bot)
export FLEET_GIT_BASE_BRANCH="main"
export FLEET_GIT_AUTHOR_NAME="autopkg-bot"

# GitOps paths (defaults: software_dir=lib/macos/software, suffix=.yml, etc.)
export FLEET_SOFTWARE_DIR="lib/macos/software"
export FLEET_PACKAGE_YAML_SUFFIX=".yml"
export FLEET_TEAM_YAML_PACKAGE_PATH_PREFIX="../lib/macos/software/"

# Optional features (defaults: branch_prefix=autopkg, pr_labels=["autopkg"])
export FLEET_BRANCH_PREFIX="autopkg"
export FLEET_PR_LABELS='["autopkg", "software-update"]'
export PR_REVIEWER="security-team"

# Recipe-specific variables
export GITHUB_DESKTOP_BUILD="darwin-arm64"  # for GitHub Desktop Apple Silicon builds
```

**Usage:**
```bash
# Set required variables once
source your-fleet-env.sh

# Run any recipe directly - no overrides needed!
autopkg run GoogleChrome.fleet.recipe.yaml
autopkg run Caffeine.fleet.recipe.yaml
autopkg run GithubDesktop.fleet.recipe.yaml
```

### Argument Order Convention

All recipe arguments use environment variables and are organized in logical groups:

1. **Parent recipe requirements** - Special arguments needed by upstream recipes (e.g., `%GITHUB_DESKTOP_BUILD%`)
2. **Core package info** - `%pkg_path%`, `%NAME%`, `%version%` (inherited from parent recipe)
3. **Fleet API configuration** - `%FLEET_API_BASE%`, `%FLEET_API_TOKEN%`, `%FLEET_TEAM_ID%`
4. **Software configuration** - `%FLEET_PLATFORM%`, `%FLEET_SOFTWARE_SLUG%`, install behavior
5. **Git/GitHub configuration** - Repository URLs, tokens, branch, author info
6. **GitOps file paths** - Team YAML path, software directory, path prefixes/suffixes
7. **Optional features** - Branch prefix, PR labels, reviewer assignment

The processor provides sensible defaults for most optional arguments, so you typically only need to set 7-10 environment variables for your entire AutoPkg setup.

## Fleet v4.74.0 Breaking Changes

Fleet v4.74.0 introduces breaking changes to the software YAML format. The processor automatically detects the Fleet server version via the `/api/v1/fleet/version` endpoint and adapts the YAML format accordingly:

**Fleet < 4.74.0 (Old Format):**
- `self_service`, `labels_include_any`, `labels_exclude_any` are stored in individual package YAML files
- Compatible with existing Fleet deployments

**Fleet >= 4.74.0 (New Format):**
- `self_service`, `labels_include_any`, `labels_exclude_any` are moved to team YAML software section
- Package YAML files contain only core metadata (name, version, platform, hash, scripts)
- Automatically detected and applied when connecting to Fleet v4.74.0+ servers

**Note:** If the version query fails, the processor defaults to the new format for modern Fleet deployments.

---

## Outputs

| Name | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `fleet_title_id` | Fleet software title ID returned by the upload API. |
| `fleet_installer_id` | Fleet installer ID returned by the upload API. |
| `git_branch` | Created branch name. |
| `pull_request_url` | URL of the created or found pull request. |
| `hash_sha256` | SHA-256 hash of the uploaded package, as returned by Fleet. |

---

## What It Writes

### Per title software YAML

Created or updated at `<repo>/<software_dir>/<software_slug><package_yaml_suffix>`, for example `lib/macos/software/firefox.yml`.

**Fleet < 4.74.0 Structure:**

```yaml
name: "Firefox"
version: "129.0.2"
platform: "darwin"
hash_sha256: "abc123..."         # if provided by Fleet response
self_service: true               # targeting - in package file
automatic_install: false        # optional macOS only
labels_include_any:              # targeting - in package file
  - "Workstations"
pre_install_query:               # optional
  query: "SELECT 1;"
install_script:                  # optional
  contents: |
    #!/bin/bash
    echo "custom install"
uninstall_script:                # optional
  contents: |
    #!/bin/bash
    echo "custom uninstall"
post_install_script:             # optional
  contents: |
    #!/bin/bash
    echo "post"
```

**Fleet >= 4.74.0 Structure:**

```yaml
name: "Firefox"
version: "129.0.2"
platform: "darwin"
hash_sha256: "abc123..."         # if provided by Fleet response
automatic_install: false        # optional macOS only
pre_install_query:               # optional
  query: "SELECT 1;"
install_script:                  # optional
  contents: |
    #!/bin/bash
    echo "custom install"
uninstall_script:                # optional
  contents: |
    #!/bin/bash
    echo "custom uninstall"
post_install_script:             # optional
  contents: |
    #!/bin/bash
    echo "post"
```

### Team YAML update

**Fleet < 4.74.0:** Simple package reference in `teams/workstations.yml`:

```yaml
software:
  packages:
    - path: ../lib/macos/software/firefox.package.yml
```

**Fleet >= 4.74.0:** Package reference with targeting metadata in `teams/workstations.yml`:

```yaml
software:
  packages:
    - path: ../lib/macos/software/firefox.package.yml
      self_service: true
      labels_include_any:
        - "Workstations"
```

## Example AutoPkg Recipe Integration

Add the processor after your build step. Example excerpt from a YAML recipe:

```yaml
Process:
- Arguments:
    # Parent recipe requirements
    pkg_path: '%pkg_path%'
    
    # Core package info (from parent recipe)
    software_title: '%NAME%'
    version: '%version%'
    
    # Fleet API configuration
    fleet_api_base: '%FLEET_API_BASE%'
    fleet_api_token: '%FLEET_API_TOKEN%'
    team_id: '%FLEET_TEAM_ID%'
    
    # Software configuration
    self_service: true
    
    # Git/GitHub configuration
    git_repo_url: '%FLEET_GITOPS_REPO_URL%'
    github_token: '%FLEET_GITOPS_GITHUB_TOKEN%'
    
    # GitOps file paths
    team_yaml_path: '%FLEET_TEAM_YAML_PATH%'
    
    # Optional features
    skip_pkg_upload: false
    verbose_mode: true
  Processor: FleetGitOpsUploader
```

## Behavior and Idempotency

- If the team YAML already references the package file, the processor does not add a duplicate.
- If the per title YAML exists, it is updated in place.
- If there are no changes to commit, the job exits cleanly without pushing a branch or creating a PR.
- Only one of `labels_include_any` or `labels_exclude_any` may be set. The processor enforces this.

---

## Permissions

- Fleet API token must allow software uploads scoped to the target team.
- GitHub token must be able to push branches to the GitOps repo and open PRs.

---

## Troubleshooting

- **401 or 403 from Fleet**  
  Verify `fleet_api_base`, token value, and that the token has rights to upload for `team_id`.

- **400 from Fleet on upload**  
  Check that the file is a valid installer for the chosen platform. For `.pkg` you can omit custom scripts unless you need overrides.

- **Git failure on push**  
  Ensure the token used by Actions can push to the repo. Check branch protection rules and required status checks. If you block direct pushes to branches that do not exist yet, create an exception for the bot or switch to a service account PAT.

- **Labels error in GitOps sync**  
  Fleet GitOps requires that labels referenced in software YAML exist in your GitOps configuration. Add missing labels or remove them from the package YAML.

- **422 on PR creation**  
  This indicates a PR already exists. The processor searches for an open PR with the same head and base and returns that URL.

- **Nothing to commit**  
  If the YAML already matches the intended state, there will be no diff. This is normal. The processor will exit cleanly without creating a branch or PR.

---

## Security Notes

- When a GitHub token is provided, the processor rewrites the Git repository URL with the token so that cloning and pushing use authenticated HTTPS URLs without prompts. `GIT_TERMINAL_PROMPT` is set to `0` to prevent interactive authentication.
- Consider scoping the GitHub token to the target repo only.
- Rotate the Fleet API token periodically.

---

## Conventions

- Branch name format: `<software-slug>-<version>` or `<branch_prefix>/<software-slug>-<version>` if `branch_prefix` is set.
- Per title YAML default directory: `lib/macos/software`. Override via `software_dir` if your repo uses a different layout.
- Team YAML reference uses a relative `path` entry. Adjust `team_yaml_package_path_prefix` if your repo structure differs.

---

## FAQ

**Q: Can it skip creating a PR and push directly to main?**  
Branch and PR is deliberate. If you want direct commits, you can set the base and head to the same branch and adjust the code. That is not recommended for audited changes.

**Q: What about label management?**  
This processor assumes labels already exist in GitOps. Managing label creation is out of scope to keep changes atomic and reviewable.
